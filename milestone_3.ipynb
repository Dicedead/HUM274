    "To create Gaussian noise, we first started with the idea to create a series of many sine waves, each represented each by numpy arrays with a certain number of values per second (using the Nyquist rate of the upper limit human hearing range). These sine waves would then be rescaled according to the specific type of Gaussian noise required. Unsurprisingly in retrospect, this proved several orders of magnitude too costly to compute.\n",

    "The solution was to actually start in the frequency domain, have a vector values to sample the human hearing range, rescaling them depending on the required sound colour (e.g. 1/frequency for pink noise), then simply using an inverse Fourier transform to go back to the time domain. This method bypasses the calculation of nearly 20,000 sine waves, each of a very large size (44100), and replaces it by a single computation on an array of size `44100 * required duration` followed by an inverse Fourier transform."

    "# III) Harmonisation\n",
    "We decided to do the implementation from scratch, i.e. not to use ``music21`` library elements as notes or chords,\n",
    "because we preferred to have an absolute control over the data structures and achieve code efficiency and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have some constants and then parameters that we can change in order to have different outcomes (and also\n",
    "for debugging...). After that, we create the utilities for the keys and we create the principal data structures for\n",
    "our implementation: chords and trees of chords.\n",
    "\n",
    "More details and clarifications about the implementation are included in the code. We have defined some functions,\n",
    "the main ones are: ``filter_w_rules`` (which applies all the harmonic rules), ``next_chords`` (that computes all the\n",
    "possible next chords from a given one and a bass note) and ``compose`` (which recursively calls ``next_chords`` and\n",
    "fills the chord tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, all that code takes as input a bass line and a starting chord and creates a tree of all the possibilities\n",
    "of that harmonisation exercise (a figured bass). Once that code is executed, the following cell defines a method for\n",
    "choosing one composition among all possibilities, and the third cell represents the starting parameters and general\n",
    "calls to the functions. The last two little cells show the resulting scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to a simple harmonisation, with some assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each note of the bass line represents its corresponding grade in the key, hence each chord is in fundamental state,\n",
    "i.e. there are no inversions.\n",
    "The chords are only formed with fifths, i.e., we do not use seventh or ninth chords."
