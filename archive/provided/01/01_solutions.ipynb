In each iterations, notes are drawn from the motto. Some notes from the motto might be sampled more frequently than the others, which introduces an imbalance. The following iteration is sampled from the output of the preceding iteration, so that imbalances are amplified from iteration to iteration, until just one note survives. When only one note is left, though, there can be no variability anymore. Slowly, the music starts dying. This is represented in the Coda of the piece, where tempo starts to slow down and rhythmic variability is progressively reduced.**\n",

In a Python script, we would have probably defined a function, say compose_this(), which would have accepted the arguments (motto, durations, n_bars_per_group, bpm, timeSig) and would have returned the finished piece as a Stream. In Jupyter, however, it is common to define the arguments at the beginning of a cell (all in one place!) and to have the remainder of the cell perform actions based on them. The output is stored in a variable that is, of course, available to all subsequent cells, in this case s.

    "while-loops are a different way to achieve iteration: not by iterating through a collection, but instead by performing all indented lines below as long as a certain *condition* is met. Conditions are expressions that evaluate to True or False. For example, you can test equality by writing `1 == 1` into a cell, `==` being the comparison operator as opposed to the assignment operator `=` (try `1 = 2`). Therefore it is essential to make sure when writing a while loop that the condition is not met anymore at some point, otherwise it is an infinite loop. The loop continues as long as `len(set(motto))` is bigger than 1. Turning a list (`motto`) into a set eliminates all duplicate items (and the order is lost, too) which is useful for checking how many *different* items are in the list, namely by checking the set's length using `len()`. In other words, the indented code below will eventually have to reduce the number of distinct items in the list `motto` to 1 in order to terminate.\n",

    "In every iteration of the while-loop, the body of the for-loop is executed 3 times because that is the value to which we set `n_bars_per_group` before. After the three iterations, a new value is assigned to `motto` (the assignment happens outside the for-loop but within the while-loop). In each iteration of the for loop, a Measure object `m` is created based on the current value of the counter variable (an integer) `measure_count`. The function `random.shuffle()` mutates (i.e. changes the value of) the list `durations` by randomly reordering its elements. Then, the notes of the new measure are computed by a list comprehension and for every note, the pitch is randomly picked from the `motto`. Append the notes to the measure, append the measure to the stream, and augment the counter by one: `measure_count += 1` is just an abbreviation (*syntactic sugar*) for `measure_count = measure_count + 1`.\n",

Hence, new time signatures need to be introduced to account for the new bar lengths. Also, since we want `durations` to remain sorted, so that the next shortest duration gets eliminated every time, we need to copy it into `sample_durations` before calling `random.shuffle()` (remember, it mutates the input).\n",

Therefore, the full expression evaluates to True if `total_duration` is not the float equivalent of an integer---and we know that in this case, it must have a `.5` decimal, so we can express the measure in `/8` rather than `/4` and double the numerator of the fraction. Both numerator and denominators are turned into strings so that can be combined to a string expressing the time signature via `n_beats+'/'+unit`.
