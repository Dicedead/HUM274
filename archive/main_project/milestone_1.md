# HUM-274: Milestone 1

## Overarching Inspiration

The piece is a study of the duality of chaos and convergence through the lens of the narrative scheme. In the same way as a disturbing element induces <em>peripeteia</em> leading to a resolution, a chaotic unit morphs and develops before converging.


## Final piece description 

The piece will be constructed so as to mirror the classic quinary narrative scheme. As such, the exposition starts with Brownian noise to which are gradually added notes from some known melody, say: Ravel's <em>Boléro</em>, following the metrical structure introduced in the lecture about time and rhythm. This is, in a sense, calm before chaos, anchoring the listener to a familiar theme to emphasize the looming disruption.

Chaos, the disruptive element, comes into play by successively: sporadically removing rhythmic values, turning all notes into eighth or quarter notes, then removing melodic attributes, restraining their range down to the tonic, progressively forgetting the initial piece's theme, and finally replacing the original piece's orchestral timbres by less conventional tone colours, perhaps urban sounds, to signify the definitive transition into chaos. 
This second part has been constructed in order to make the listener lose their balance, abruptly going from a known melody to a rhythmically simplified theme, and then finally into drone, distorted music. This sudden transition makes it all the more alienating and forces the listener to fully experience the emergence of chaotic elements.

The next part, starting on a sforzando, appends complexity, continuing the <em>peripeteia</em> by readding non-binary rhythmical elements, perhaps quintuplets and other prime divisions, and creating harmonic surprises through a change in tonality, much like the <em>Boléro</em>'s ending. Then, the rhythmical and melodic aspects reconverge to a new theme resembling the original one, symbolising narrative falling action.
This convergence is done in two parts. Firstly, the rhythm converges to a cycle after some polymetric irregularity, then the melodic aspects of the theme come back on top, with the original tonality first. 
This should bring back peace into the listener, finding some sense in what had been reduced to ambient, stressful music.

Finally, the piece converges to a narrative resolution, exposed for some measures before decrescendoing into the ending. Resolution should bring satisfaction and a sense of finality, reaching some state derived from the initial situation and theme, as a protagonist remembering the time before their adventures.

Max Richter's *Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi - The Four Seasons*, in particular *Spring 1*, is an inspiration to this piece as it has given the idea of selecting themes from an original piece then trying to reconstruct that piece from these themes. This confers the piece a minimalistic setting, emphasized by the urban samples, shared with *City Life - Check it out* by Steve Reich. Another common trait of this piece and Steve Reich's is the piecewise rhythmic regularity imposed by the *Boléro*.

In the following part, among other things, we will explain how we've created chaos then made it converge through the use of a carefully chosen L-system.
